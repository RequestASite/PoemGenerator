The highest omen
When we come rollin,
The chosen are strolling
Into the open, hoping,

That one of the next up
Would come and contest us
So they can attest that were best
Time to flex up,

And stunt on the competition,
Calculus, our decisions,
Never missing,
Not a christian,
But the devils comin,
You best run and listen,
Demolition is the mission
Eyes with hunger’s glisten

Pixels

Staring at my phone,
Watching pixels as the time passes,
Pitiful rituals criminal as my mind taxes

With subliminal visuals far beyond me
How could delirium present itself so damn fondly,
Hardly noticed drift,
And now that the time is gone I’ve
Partly regained a grip,
Nights spent recollecting how
Haunting it was slip
Back into the abyss,
The quickest of dips became,
“How many months ago was it?”

And then it hits you,
The presence of a greater issue.
Ripe with misuse,
Regret in every bone and tissue.

Chaos then ensues,
“Is it even worth it to continue?”,
I yearn to learn can a fire burn
In a soul so long withdrew.

Jagger


Like the jagged hilt of a dagger
Owned by the boy that would rather
Be content with irrelevance
When the burning flags start to tatter
And splatter against the concrete
When fire makes it all shatter;
Raining pieces of peace
That would reign before it would fracture


I capture the likes of weapons
Resented by their own captor,
But deadly when steadied and ready to levy on bastards
A knowledge they’ve never reckoned with
Second just to the Rapture,
Complex are all my sentiments
Stories then told thereafter-

Woeful laughter

The Embrace of Winter
The gentle flurry of snowflakes like a quiet dance of
stars
Small kisses from the heavens  descending upon me,
Painting my coat with their every brief
affection.
Falling, falling,
towards the soft embrace of the ground,
A sea of white extending before me in
All directions, a smooth, rolling stability,
Pierced by the dark browns of tree trunks, their
Bare, jagged, branches scraping the sky;


These beautiful dichotomies of winter.

Pineapples and Peas

Pineapples and peas, or sauteed sardines,
Or pepperoni, crust, and cheese; holy trinity.
Such divinity eating triple-cheese supremes,
Hunting for the best food, and pizza’s the epitome.

Are you kidding me?

No need to grandstand,
In your silence I see your demands damned,
And your plans that you know you can’t ban
From your mind despite the long timespan

In which you and I continue this dance,
Still coming to grips with this distance,
Guns, Roses, and whips slip
From my grasp to tax

I call it crooked change,
Took one look and was shook, 9 dimensions rearranged,
When demons came, thought to how I told myself that my world was tamed,
Then the waves just marched in crashing, views never the same

Am I deranged? Or  simply a car with mileage,
Damaged but still defiantly styling amongst the giants
Crying at all the effort I’m putting in these endeavors,
Merry at all my heaviness, blessed by the storms I’ve weathered.

Damn,

Here I  go again,

The spark formed when bleeding hearts bend

Apartments, filled with the marksmen

That shot into dark with hopes to take apart

The weary rot that walks in and talks sin,

Toxins that could fell army of 50 million oxen

I’m locked in, toppling all my dark trends

Both foe and friends can catch wind,

Hope that at the end we can make amends,  new precedents.


$

I know I’ll never touch the stars,
This brilliance so high above.
Shining light into the darkness they call their home,
Breathing life into barren worlds.
They’ll never how much they mean to me here,
Or What this world would be like without them.
So far away yet right within sight,
So for now, I write them this poem.

Kiss Of Death


Reminiscing on criticisms malicious in merit,
Mind weaving and tearing, wary from the burdens I carry
Forevering comparing behemoths with the  demons I scheme with
The dream of this valley in pieces brings me peace, and it scares me

My wisdom’s scarcity unsparingly keeps my ego flaring
The type of fool to feel that God and himself are worth comparing-
Impairing my intuition, while daring all my ambitions
While lovers feel the divisions, and others love the decision

To rid myself of opposition that I see mount in my vision
That I created and orchestrated, due to lack of a  mission
And a need to have a soul on hand for cruel demolition
To fuel my crippling dissonance for your intimate wishes

Words teeming with lies, doubting that you even realize,
The ways I’ll decry every piece of strength in your mind
With methods sublime, damage only revealed with time,
No longer thinking of distinctions between your dreams and mine

So let us commence a toast, glasses high to sky,
Filled with the tears of hearts I’ve broke, my smile bright and wide.
So when you’re lying on the ground, crying, wondering why
Just remember when I warned you of the demon inside.











$
I try to channel some anger to handle this silence of pen,
The faces of  strangers - the dangers of mangled amends,
The cheers and the sorrows for paths we shall never ascend,
The silent cry in your eyes when I told you “Never again”.

Defenses lowered and common sense gone,
Every action made under an influence.
A balancing act between restraint and truth,
Or whatever the latter now means to me.
How could all this wisdom so quickly be washed away,
Destabilized with every meaningless movement.
I desperately grasp for an anchor from all this glory,
This painful responsibility of mine.

Love’s made me a fool.
$
Crimson Behemoth

Eyes ablaze
Unfazed by your derangement,
So quick to break-
An ape within containment.
Cruel estrangement when
Feet come hit the pavement.
Do you run to feel numb
Or break from your temptations?

Patient waiting - contemplating the next question,
Second guessing the blessings of my correction and
My Complexion,
My Conception
My Perception
My discretion a lost connection;

But still I rise
My tired eyes have grown long wary,
I bleed truths through this pen when
My beliefs scare me.
I lay unsurprised when their lies come tearing
So when my demons come along, friends, please compare me

Break my heart apart-
Let sirens come blaring
While I lay on the ground
Just stand over me staring,
Then reach hand up,
Let me stand up,
Let me stand tough
Then run with me until the next pairing.

The pain is daring -

But just a stop on my itinerary.
On a path to be legendary.

To Chase A Butterfly


My intuition is telling me they'll be better days,
Thinking back to the close calls and near escapes,
A silent room deadlier than a gun to my face,
Yet here on these silent nights I contemplate,

And lay my pains to the name of a Higher Power,
I call it the man in the mirror, ally till my last hour.
Beautiful cowards, our truths we devour;
Bleed it out through this pen - a colorless flower;

I’m letting in bloom, fed by the blood in the room
Gently lit by the moon, I know these wounds will heal soon,
Finding comfort in cartoons and the rap that I boom,
As these hours keep dragging on, till the dawn I will loom

Just to feel the heat of the sun’s kiss wash over me,
My brightened eyes revitalized - I write these words potently,
I share my pain openly, every cry done vocally.
Flower still in my hand - I’m chasing down all I hope to be.

A Kiss



It moved like a
Body in free fall, contorting and
Twisting in all the wrong ways,
My eyes awakened by
The angry, violet glow
Emanating from it while it moved down
The midnight hallway,
Slowly. Slowly. Slowly. Slowly.
No eyes
No feet
No sound,
But I felt it’s gaze,
I felt its gaze.
The bloodlust of a predator,
Standing just inside my room.

Then it closed the door.

Because They Asked



The silence is deafening,
Pen at my side as I spend these late nights
Lost in my computer screen;
Trying to let the hands of these
Looming shadows pry at my mind,
Groping at every sickly memory and
childhood joy -
My body pitifully bare as they cross every boundary.
All in the name
Of finding
A poem.







$
I know the path I follow is unconventional; such potential though
My every move I make is intentional - my ascension slow
But will never show a stop in momentum, I’m hellbent on growth
Evolving with every painful involvement, love as cold as snow

But all I know, so onward I roll - some days with half control.
The things they say have taken their toll, hearts I’ve gave and stole
Some days I wish to just take it back to toys and lego stacks,
When I gave myself some slack for relapsing; those days are  over so

I spend these long nights, hard sober
Coasting on boastful emotions
Memories flood in plentifully
A trapeze over the ocean

Pitifully, I appease to all those demons;
I’m hoping
if humanity can’t show me love
Darkness won’t cut me open.




$



Incomplete


I’m forever wary of the dawn,
The cemetery my subsidiary - moving on
What’s a memory that you never draw upon?
Deely buried; highly scary when you realize all the wrongs.

Calm longing; half appalling when death’s not around the corner,
Burn myself when by the stove, bleach with my corona.
Going off the deep end - why   keep preaching to a donor?












$


Lettin the water wash away my sorrows
No hope for tomorrow.
Contemplate a day, a way,
Escaped into another bottle,
Gone full throttle, off the deep end-
Creepin towards a new debacle
But not looking to be coddled
Me and pain; this is betrothal

Topple the unthoughtful in my plot to stop the rot that follows
When the awful grovel at the feet of those with hearts gone hollow,

The Loving Rapture

Like a leopard preying on dragons

Or 90s lakers to mavericks,

There's magic within my havoc, no other way I would have it

With bastards filling the the caskets

Due to their actions erratic

Then I use their bones to ascend the throne,

Wear the crown backwards; the chapters

Semicollapsing the stagnance within my mind,

The prominence of the factions enacting on my decline,

Every day spent grappling these actions beyond my time,

Constant scrapping for power - the hours or just the dimes?

Reflections


The night my mother dies, I might be

In a room, in a bed, under a blanket,
Mind two-tenths from dead as I swipe against the
dancing pixels on my phone, as to escape that
Hollow silence of the night and all it brings.

Or maybe, I might be
Making love to a stranger, after a
Long night and third glass of wine,
My fingers feeling along their shoulder blade
As hers grow still forevermore.

Or maybe, I might be
Playing with my future child,
Her eyes glossing over as they
Run into my loving arms,
Tackling me with youthful innocence as they
Gaze into my warm, hazel eyes.

But wherever I may be when the piercing night comes,
A knowing unease in my stomach when the phone rings,
I can’t help but wonder how
much of me will die with her

Static Rhymes

Despite the slights of titans I’m still fightin’
The words I write as bright as strikes of lightin’
Tales of nights with skin to knife, blade cold as  ice,
Those lonesome nights patrolled by their lethal plights

Their lies would light my mind with blind delight
A brief respite from the mines placed left and right,
A constant dance not to ignite your dynamite,
My legs grew weak, forgot to stand at my full height

My heart grew tight; eyes dry of tears to wipe
Your final yell had spelled my final night,
So with all my might, I stand; a frantic fight
They stole my life; but now? I hold the light.

An Ode To JID

I remain like stone,
A solid earthen thing,
Unmoved the drones of the birds that sing,
And bells that ring,
When shot by slings,
Unfelt by kings,
But quells a temperance in anything
That’s dealt with the slow  decadence  of excellence,
Decayed into a realm of reverence and irrelevance,
These words represent the opulence within my temperament.
Now
I’m testing it all
So now I call
To Allah, Shiva,
The Timeless One,
To Jah,
To the Messiah, to aether,
The time has come to brawl.


$

Starved and Desperate
There’s fatality in sensuality,
Or is depravity just another part of me ?
Lost my ethics, morality, and very reality
Chasing all the curves and parts I could not see.

Always running but never could hit a destination,
How much more am I willing to give to these temptations?
Thought I was strong in the heart ‘til I was alone in the dark
Wondering if there was still hope for my liberation.

Back Where We Don't Belong

Night has fallen in that

Old way it does,

Longing shadows gently

Surrounding all of us.

Never thought it would return

Perhaps the jokes on me

For trying to change what has been true

For all eternity.

And perhaps eternally Ill anguish,

I think I knew it along.

For all the times we fought and cried, we're

Back where we don't belong.

Be My Mercy

I’m flattered that you think of my body so highly,
But I don’t feel all that sexy tonight.
My fingers too weighted to dance across your form,
My chest too hollow to call your name.
My mind lost in turmoils I myself don’t understand,
My body feeling three decades older.
I’m sorry that I cannot love your body tonight,
But please, come hold my own.

Here goes


Consume me

Show me all that I never thought I was.

Be the haunting shadows in the depths of the trenches,

and the sun kissed lips of the mountains before them.

Be the blood flowing from the wound you so desperately try to fix,

and the dagger that killed me so.

I surrender myself to your will,

no more resistance.

Oh so curious of

how this journey will end

Unfinished and Untitled

Troubled soul, troubled soul,

Won't you rest your head here?

And from my lap gaze out at the landscape before us,

This world of twists and turns.

Let your walls crumble to dust.

Why fight to hide this pain you'll soon understand, and

come to know as your birthright.

And troubled soul, troubled soul,

Won't you stay awake for just a little longer.

I see  all the things that will lie before you,

What a glorious future ahead.

New Flame

Dynamic forces in courtship, run towards it,

contorted abortions of fortune, and throats slit,

Fantastical happenings enacted by loved ticks,

attracted by factions in action, and blood drip,

And love split,

by barriers unseen by the eye,

biking on down hill,

just, asking God why,

He cast us down from heaven,

into our own enterprise,

said he loves us all,

but tell that to the first sons,

with long-closed eyes.


I realize, the imminent demise,

from these ashes, I hope new flames arise,

Those who scorn the warning,

mourn next morning,

Those who can't adapt

just won't survive







Perplexing introspections, my complexion,

nine dimensions, gone without a mention,

broken friendship,

Selfishness

For me, the

true pain of

isolation isn't

the silent halls,

the unwarmed bed,

the unfulfilled fantasies

in tandem with

untouched lips,

but this pure, blinding love I'm

unable to give,

this void between my arms

Moonlight and Cigarettes

I've no longer the strength to play your games,

to hear your call, to hate my name,

to try to feed what cannot thrive,

to try to save what wishes to die,

to try to love what cannot receive,

to try to trust in one who thieves,

to try to clean what's meant to rust,

and to try to stay for one more dusk.


Goodbye, my love.

Naive
My actions were never intended to hurt,

but so much pain I've caused.

Innocent intentions  with which I worked,

so much said with a single pause.

I got careless, reckless, as I so often do.

Played with forces I didn't understand.

Wish I had realized that a pure heart

doesn't free you of the gun in your hand.

Wish I had realized that the most powerful things are those that go without mention,

Wish I'd remembered there's so much more in the world,

beyond my mind and few dimensions.


Wish I could heal the wounds and all they brought,

with the words I have to say.

But in the end, all that's left is shame,

with fire I'd chosen to play.

On my knees, but still I'll walk,

repairing as I know how.

Has all that's left been burned to ashes?

To such pity these words amount.

Denying My Right

When the final walls come crashing down, and my longing flows out like the river

I want you to look into my eyes, and hold my hand,

and say you love me too.

When you wake in the morning, the mess I know you'll be, and pinch your face at the sunlight

 I want you to look into my eyes, so warm and gentle, and see a gaze worth a thousand words.

Amd when that incredible day comes that we make love under the orange, setting sun,

I want to hear you call my name,


And when passion has succeeded and our desire's been quenched,


I want you to hold me till deep in the night.

Such a tangled mess, the human heart and mind,

forgive me for my recent distance.

My love is real, let there be no mistake,

but I can't imagine the world I long for.

Just Souls, you and I


I can't promise you'll find very much within me,

Just another soul passing you by.

With feet that stand just a bit too crooked,

And gentle anxiety within my eyes.

You might not think I've suffered far  too much,

Nor  say very far I've came.

You might not see me as the special one

Whose face you'd want on a picture frame.

You may hate the way I stare you down,

and that suffocating silence I love to drift 'round,

and the way I'd let you think we were near,

then take my secrets and long disappear.

And fear the burden I often know I am,

The twisted mess I can rarely understand.


So I can't promise you'll find very much within me,

Just soul amongst those in the rough.

Now feel free to hate me and all i am,

for you read my poem, and that is enough.

The Unholy Beauty
The lengths we go to try to find it,
The wait for it  to pass us by.
The peace after wounds have finally healed, and the
grief from  when it's  died.
The things we do to fill its absence, or
spare us from its pain.
When you're hurt by the things you never truly had,
when you feel you've loved in vain.
When maybe you've loved a just bit too much, or
a bit too little all the same.
All to learn to learn how to love just perfectly enough,
And finally reap its gains.

Sometimes I lose myself in the souls I  pass by,

Sometimes I lose myself in the depths of entertainment,

grasping desperately for what isn't there.

And too often, I lose myself in the realm of my mind,

Heaven and Hell  waiting  for me so patiently...

Those Lonesome Nights
It was another one of those nights where I'd
stepped just a bit too deep in my mind.
Memories and anxieties started taking their toll as
that feeling in my chest returned
I tried dueling with it at first, resisting my
darker temptations, working through the
thorns in the brambles.
But before I even realized, the drink had passed lips
and the fury dulled,
just enough for me to
function.

while driving down the street.

Down to meet,

I know that one day you'll come around to me

Unrequited



What is a love that you cannot hold,
on a woman whose lips you cannot taste,
on a face whose eyes you cannot gaze into,

in a body whose form your fingers cannot dance across,
that hosts a soul more vast, mysterious, and gorgeous than you'll ever know.

And what am I reduced to for wanting it still.

An Old Poem

Sunlight bouncing off textured walls,

Lonely cobwebs in mansion halls.

Peaceful death of falling rain.

Sunlight shone on rivers slain.
_____
One with the earth, and wind and stars,

Stories untold in abandoned cars.

The snake and mouse play a lethal game,

the blood that follows, for a higher name.
____
And Higher I see, and higher I grow

But, it seems that not even the mountains know

how to meet the stars, or our creator above,

I found him a cat's mouth,  a long-dead dove.
